# operating_platforms

The Gaming Room was a mobile app game creator on the Android platform. The client wanted to develop a web-based version of its current Android app to make the game available across multiple platforms and devices.

I wrote a recommendation section outlining key areas for the client’s consideration including the host operating system (OS), memory and storage management solutions on host servers, the API framework, security, and the benefits of a serverless architecture to launch the product.

Using the domain model as a UML diagram proved beneficial in understanding the structure of and relationship between entities representing the app components. This helped in developing classes with methods that used other entities to form a clean prototype.

The evaluation section comparing and contrasting popular OS's (i.e. Mac, Windows, Linux) and mobile platforms could be improved with a deeper dive into the implication between the platforms on the client side. OS favor toward particular browsers (i.e. Windows to Edge, Mac to Safari, etc.) could be analyzed in more depth to see if non-favored browsers introduce technical or performance constraints.

Key needs to consider for the user when developing web based apps are speed and usability. The quality is also important, but less so when compared to speed and usability. For example, a user may continue to use the app if they don not care for the look, but will forget about the site if functionality is not user-friendly or slow. User needs are the most important to consider because they are the ultimate source of revenue for the client.

When designing software, I like to take high-level objectives and work them through various iterations to turn them into the final solution. For example, a client’s business objectives can be broken down into functional requirements outlining the key pieces of functionality needed to meet those objectives. Functional requirements can be further broken down into technical requirements that outline the technical approach to functional fulfillment. Technical requirements can then be translated into design documents, architecture, and code that fulfills those requirements and delivers the final solution.
